Charity is the condition of the spiritual value of almsgiving.\n\nThe gift thus allows the lay donor to integrate the ritual community of the monastery and to take his place in the exchange with God. For medieval man is conscious of the debt he owes to Him who gave to man all the earthly riches, of which he is indebted and for which he must be paid." # Source : https://www.cairn.info/revue-du-mauss-2002-1-page-309.htm
