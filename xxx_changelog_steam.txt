##############################PARADOX MOD
##NAME
-My Monastery-

##SHORT DESC
This mod's core feature is adding a new holding type: the monastery, as well as some flavour around it. 

##FULL DESC
This mod's core feature is adding a new holding type: the monastery, as well as some flavour around it.


Current content, to be expanded:

    ordering to take vows send to a monastic court, women will become guest or wanderers
    populated with monasteries (random + historical)
    all faiths with monasticism (either historical or from reformation) can hold or build monasteries
    some monks are generated to populate courts, they can be elected abbot on succession
    people ordered to take vows can be elected abbots


Planned or work in progress features:

    deal with religion incompatibility (converting or destroying the monastery holding)
    developing specific building chains, reworking the main building chain
    specific vassal contracts
    various flavour interactions or events
